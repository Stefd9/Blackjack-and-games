# Blackjack-and-games

The original blackjack game where you must be closer to 21 than your opponent. Continue to press HIT until you feel you are as close to 21 as you can get.
But becareful not to HIT too much or you may end up going over 21 and BUSTING. The opponent is a computer with a little bit of AI. 

This added a nice challenge to coding the JavaScript for this project. The styling with CSS also allowed me to exeperiment with styling and making things look pleasing to the eye.
